Data Fetching and data mutating is very important in web application. So, Next.js provide features like data fetching, data caching and revalidating.

### Data Fetching with fetch

<Callout emoji='⚠️'>
  **Disclaimer:** Next.js extends the native fetch Web API to allow you to
  configure the caching and revalidating behavior for each fetch request on the
  server. React extends fetch to automatically memoize fetch requests while
  rendering a React component tree.

You can use [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) with `async/await` in Server Components, in [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), and in [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).

### For example :
