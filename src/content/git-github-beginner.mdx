### What is Git?

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that allows users to store, share, and collaborate on code. It provides a web-based interface that uses Git, an open-source version control software.

### Key Concepts

- **Repositories**: A repository contains all of your code, files, and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your work within the repository.

- **Commit**: A commit in GitHub is a snapshot of a project's state at a specific point in time and is a fundamental building block of a Git project's timeline.

- **Branch**: A branch in GitHub is a pointer to a snapshot of changes in a repository.
