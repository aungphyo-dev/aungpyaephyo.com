### What is git?

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that allows users to store, share, and collaborate on code. It's a web-based interface that uses Git, an open source version control software.

##### Key concepts

1. Repositories
   - A repository contains all of your code, your files, and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your work within the repository.
2. Commit
   - A commit in GitHub is a snapshot of a project's state at a specific point in time, and is a fundamental building block of a Git project's timeline.
3. Branch
   - A branch in GitHub is a pointer to a snapshot of changes in a repository.

### Prerequisites

- Pre-Install Ubuntu 24.04
- Sudo User with Admin rights
- GitHub Account

### Update your system with this following command

```

### Install git on Ubuntu 24.04 (LTS)

Now, you can install git on ubuntu 24.04 with this following command

```
sudo apt install git
```

Press ‘Y’ when prompted to confirm the installation, and the system will automatically download and install Git on your system.

Git and its dependencies are installed then confirm git version by running this following command

```
git --version
```

If git installation is success, Git version displayed on your terminal.

```
╭── ~
╰────▶ git --version
git version 2.43.0
```

### Configure git

In order to use git, it is recommended to configure your identity first. Replace the “Name” and “email address” in below git commands as per your setup.

```shell
git config --global user.name "Aung Pyae Phyo"
git config --global user.email "hi@aungpyaephyo.com"
```

Log your git config in your terminal by running this following command

```
cat .gitconfig
```

Git config displayed on your terminal.

### Create a Folder and Initialize a Git Repository

Now, let’s create a new folder for your project and initialize a Git repository. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project folder and run the following commands:

```shell
mkdir "project_name"
cd "project_name"
git init
```

Git default branch will be `master` and I move to `main` branch by running following command

```
git branch -M main
```

### Make changes and Commit

```
git status
```

Once you’ve made your changes, it’s time to commit them to the Git repository:

```shell
git add .
git commit -m 'first commit'
```

This command stages all changes (using `git add .`) and commits them with a message describing the changes.

### Create a GitHub repository

- Login to your GitHub account
- Create a new repository

![create repo](/blog/git-ubuntu/create-repo-1.png)

- Enter your repository name
- chose your access modifier

![create repo](/blog/git-ubuntu/create-repo-2.png)

- Click `Create Repository`

we will get following set of instruction for the repository.

### Generate `ssh` key from Ubuntu 24.04(LTS)

Run ssh-keygen command from the terminal.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

```
╭── ~
╰────▶ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/typle/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/typle/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/typle/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:xtO3i6SViPi+AuJv6Ie/M03lFUx8iKVcERFWUDeGspM typle@lenovo
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|        *@Xo.+   |
|      ..+* oo .  |
|       o  *      |
|       o E       |
|      o S o .    |
|. .  o + o o .   |
|..o.+ . . + .    |
| + =.o   + . .   |
|..=++o+.. . .    |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Now copy the content of your public key, run below cat command.

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Paste it on your GitHub account for authentication as shown below:

- Go to GitHub settings
- Go to SSH keys and GPG keys
- Click `new ssh key`

![ssh key github](/blog/git-ubuntu/ssh.png)

- Add your title
- Select key type as `authentication key`
- Add your ssh key

After creating the GitHub repository and ssh keys, follow the instructions provided on the repository page to connect your local repository to the remote GitHub repository. This typically involves adding a remote URL:

```shell
git remote add origin git@github.com:aungpyaephyo1412/project_name.git
git remote -v
```

### Push Changes to GitHub Repository

Finally, push your local changes to the GitHub repository, run “git push” command.

```
git push -u origin main
```

Finally, go to your GitHub repository and view your code
